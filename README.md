Text Encryption – Mini DES
Synopsis
Program for encoding and decoding a secret 9-bit key into a fixed length text message applied with Simplified DES and Block cipher modes of encryption using Java coding techniques.

Code
The code is structured as follows
•	Takes input a fixed length converts that input into bits. 
•	Encrypts the input with secret message resulting in an output.
•	Decrypts output.
•	Presents input plaintext and secret message in letters and numbers to user.
